Difference between BFS and DFS

Feature	BFS (Breadth First Search)	DFS (Depth First Search)

Traversal Method	Level by level	Depth-wise (goes deep first)
Data Structure Used	Queue	Stack (or recursion)
Approach	Explores all neighbors first	Explores one path fully before backtracking
Shortest Path	Finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs	Does not guarantee shortest path
Memory Usage	High (stores all nodes at current level)	Low (only stores current path)
Implementation	Iterative	Often recursive
Example Use	Shortest route, social networks	Maze solving, topological sorting
