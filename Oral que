🧠 Assignment 1: DFS & BFS

💬 Viva Questions & Answers

1. Q: What is DFS?
A: DFS (Depth First Search) explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.


2. Q: What is BFS?
A: BFS (Breadth First Search) explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.


3. Q: What data structure is used in DFS?
A: Stack (can be implemented using recursion).


4. Q: What data structure is used in BFS?
A: Queue.


5. Q: Is DFS recursive or iterative?
A: DFS can be both, but often implemented recursively.


6. Q: Is BFS recursive?
A: No, BFS is generally iterative.


7. Q: Where is DFS used?
A: In maze solving, topological sorting, and pathfinding.


8. Q: Where is BFS used?
A: In shortest path (unweighted graphs) and level-order traversal.


9. Q: Difference between DFS and BFS?
A: DFS goes deep, BFS goes level by level.


🎯 Assignment 2: A (A-Star) Algorithm*

💬 Viva Questions & Answers

1. Q: What is A* Algorithm?
A: It’s a pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path using cost + heuristic.


2. Q: What is the formula used in A*?
A: f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
(g = actual cost, h = heuristic cost).


3. Q: What is a heuristic function?
A: It estimates the cost from the current node to the goal.


4. Q: Why is A* better than Dijkstra’s algorithm?
A: A* uses heuristics to guide the search, making it faster.


5. Q: Where is A* used?
A: In games, GPS navigation, and robotics.


6. Q: What is an example of heuristic?
A: Manhattan or Euclidean distance.

♟️ Assignment 3: Alpha-Beta Pruning

💬 Viva Questions & Answers

1. Q: What is Alpha-Beta pruning?
A: It reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the minimax algorithm.


2. Q: What are Alpha and Beta?
A: Alpha = best value for maximizer; Beta = best value for minimizer.


3. Q: Does Alpha-Beta pruning affect the result?
A: No, it gives the same result faster.


4. Q: Where is it used?
A: In two-player games like chess or tic-tac-toe.


5. Q: What is the purpose of pruning?
A: To skip unnecessary branches.

👑 Assignment 4: Constraint Satisfaction (N-Queens / Graph Coloring)

💬 Viva Questions & Answers

1. Q: What is a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)?
A: A problem where variables must satisfy certain constraints.


2. Q: What is the N-Queens problem?
A: Placing N queens on a chessboard so that no two attack each other.


3. Q: What is Backtracking?
A: A method to try possible solutions and backtrack if a constraint fails.


4. Q: What is Branch and Bound?
A: It’s an optimization technique that cuts off unpromising branches early.


5. Q: Difference between Backtracking and Branch & Bound?
A: Backtracking finds a solution; Branch & Bound finds the best one.


6. Q: Where is Graph Coloring used?
A: In scheduling, map coloring, and register allocation.

💡 Assignment 5: Greedy Algorithms

💬 Viva Questions & Answers

1. Q: What is a Greedy Algorithm?
A: It makes the locally best choice at each step, aiming for a global optimum.


2. Q: Example of Greedy Algorithm?
A: Prim’s, Kruskal’s, Dijkstra’s algorithms.


3. Q: What is Prim’s Algorithm?
A: Finds Minimum Spanning Tree by choosing the smallest edge from the growing tree.


4. Q: What is Kruskal’s Algorithm?
A: Builds MST by selecting smallest edges without forming a cycle.


5. Q: What is Dijkstra’s Algorithm?
A: Finds the shortest path from a source to all other vertices.


6. Q: Difference between Prim’s and Kruskal’s?
A: Prim’s grows a single tree; Kruskal’s builds multiple trees and merges them.


7. Q: What is Job Scheduling Problem?
A: Selecting jobs with deadlines and profits to maximize total profit.

💬 Assignment 6: Chatbot (Customer Interaction)

💬 Viva Questions & Answers

1. Q: What is a Chatbot?
A: A program that simulates human conversation using text or voice.


2. Q: What are the types of Chatbots?
A: Rule-based and AI-based.


3. Q: What is NLP?
A: Natural Language Processing – helps computers understand human language.


4. Q: Which Python libraries are used for Chatbots?
A: NLTK, ChatterBot, or simple if-else logic.


5. Q: What are intents in a Chatbot?
A: Intents represent the purpose of the user’s input (like “order pizza”, “get help”).


6. Q: What are the advantages of Chatbots?
A: 24/7 support, quick responses, and cost savings.
